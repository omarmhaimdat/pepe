## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/omarmhaimdat/pepe/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0) - 2026-09-30

### Added

- rework the Stats view into cards over a full-height distribution
- richer Live view, compact monochrome heatmap
- request filters, calmer colors, redrawn mascot
- latency heatmap, end-of-run verdict and a chili mascot
- interactive dashboard with live charts, and a much faster load path

### Fixed

- dashboard freezing when the terminal falls behind, slow resizes

### Other

- bump the minor version for feature releases before 1.0

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/omarmhaimdat/pepe/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1) - 2026-09-29

### Other

- release v0.3.1
- fix false failure in R2 publish verification

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- `--duration` / `-z`: run for a fixed time (`10s`, `5m`, `2h`) instead of a fixed request count
- `--json`: run without the dashboard and print a JSON summary (latency min/max/avg/std dev and P50/P90/P95/P99, status codes, error breakdown, throughput) to stdout. Exits when the run completes; Ctrl-C stops early and reports `"interrupted": true`
- `pepe self-update` for installs made with the shell or PowerShell installer
- Prebuilt binaries for macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel), Linux (x86_64, ARM64, statically linked) and Windows (x86_64), published automatically with checksums and build attestations
- New install methods: `irm https://pepe.mhaimdat.com/install.ps1 | iex` (Windows) and a Nix flake (`nix run github:omarmhaimdat/pepe`)
- Dashboard: "Errors" (connection failures, now separate from timeouts) and "Error Rate"

### Fixed
- Crash in duration mode once more requests completed than `-n` (default 100), which also left the terminal in raw mode
- The terminal is restored if pepe ever panics
- Restart (`r`) and stop (`i`) now cancel the running load; `i` stops and keeps the results on screen instead of restarting
- Statistics cover every request; the JSON report previously only used the last 100 and counted failures twice
- Request body (`-d`) is sent for every method, not only POST
- `--disable-keepalive` now opens a new connection per request
- Connection errors are no longer reported as timeouts
- Data transferred counts the bytes actually received (previously 0 for chunked or compressed responses)
- Standard deviation used the previous average
- Invalid `-H` headers are rejected with an error instead of crashing; repeated headers are kept
- No crash on narrow terminals; memory no longer grows during long runs
- Update notice no longer suggests "updating" to an older version, goes to stderr, and can be disabled with `PEPE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`
- Fixed the hosted `install.sh`

### Changed
- DNS is resolved with the system resolver (reqwest `hickory-dns` removed), matching the DNS timing pepe reports
- Latency is measured from sending the request, excluding pepe's own DNS timing lookup
- Latency is shown with sub-millisecond precision
- Security updates for quinn-proto, rustls-webpki, ring, bytes and tokio
